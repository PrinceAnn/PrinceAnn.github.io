# Internship Experience
* Company: Pinduoduo
* Position: Algorithm Intern
* Period: 2025-6.26 - 2025-9.26
* Work Areas:
* Text Recognition Based on OCR Technology:
Processed shipping labels from different countries in online business scenarios.
The complete OCR pipeline consisted of three parts: text detection, orientation classification, and text recognition.
Focused on fine-tuning the text recognition model using Baidu's open-source PaddleOCRv3.
Fine-tuned the official pre-trained Chinese and English models, updated dictionaries, and added support for Greek, Slavic (Bulgarian), and Danish languages.
Used MobileNetV3 as the backbone and CTC decoding for inference, deploying the ONNX model online.
Evaluated PP-OCRv3 and the newly released PP-OCRv5 in business scenarios, aligning dimensions via model pruning (essentially adjusting the dictionary dimensions of the last fully connected layer).
* Google CAPTCHA Crawler Project:
Involved three types of CAPTCHAs:
Text CAPTCHA: Solved using OCR technology, employing the same methods and frameworks as above.
3x3 Grid CAPTCHA: Modeled as a supervised binary classification task for known categories. For unknown categories, used the CLIP model for zero-shot inference by combining image and semantic information. Fine-tuned datasets for known categories and deployed online.
4x4 Grid CAPTCHA: Due to unknown categories, modeled as a referring segmentation task (combining semantic information for segmentation). Used Meituan's open-source HyperSeg model, with the VLLM module leveraging Mipha - 3B (a multimodal input model based on Phi - 2.7B). Semantic segmentation employed the Mask2former model. Conducted instruction fine-tuning and participated in online deployment.
